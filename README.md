# Coach Intelligence

Welcome to **Coach Intelligence**, an advanced system designed to empower football coaches with real-time tactical insights during matches. By analyzing live data, player performance, and opponent strategies, this project delivers actionable recommendations for substitutions, tactical adjustments, and match predictions, revolutionizing the integration of AI in football.

Developed by **SUI TEAM**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Coach Intelligence** leverages cutting-edge AI to provide coaches with data-driven insights, enabling smarter decisions on the pitch. Key functionalities include real-time performance analysis, smart substitution recommendations, opponent tactic breakdowns, and augmented reality (AR) visualizations, all accessible through an intuitive Flutter-based mobile app.

### Core Features
1. **Real-Time Performance Analysis**  
   - Tracks player movements, speed, and match stats using GPS and video data.
   - Outputs instant reports (e.g., "Left-back struggling defensively") and tactical suggestions (e.g., "Increase pressure on opponent‚Äôs right flank").
   
2. **Smart Substitutions & Fitness Monitoring**  
   - Recommends substitutions based on player fatigue and performance, using wearable sensor data (heart rate, stress levels).
   - Predicts substitute impact and flags injury risks.

3. **Opponent Tactical Analysis**  
   - Identifies opponent patterns (e.g., "70% attacks from wings") using video and historical data.
   - Suggests countermeasures (e.g., "Deeper defense to close flanks").

4. **Match Scenario Prediction**  
   - Forecasts match events (e.g., likelihood of scoring) using Reinforcement Learning and LSTM models.
   - Proposes alternative strategies (e.g., "Switch to 5-4-1 if leading by minute 75").

5. **Instant Video Analysis**  
   - Highlights critical moments (e.g., defensive errors) with short video clips extracted via FFmpeg.
   - Provides actionable feedback based on Computer Vision analysis.

6. **Voice Command Support**  
   - Enables coaches to issue commands (e.g., ‚ÄúBest substitutions now?‚Äù) using `speech_to_text` and NLP (Dialogflow/BERT).
   - Delivers voice and visual responses via Flutter‚Äôs `Card` or `ListTile`.
